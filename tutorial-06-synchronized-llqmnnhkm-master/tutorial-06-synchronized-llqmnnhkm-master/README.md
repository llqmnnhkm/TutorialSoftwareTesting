## Your Info:
1. Matric Number:
1. Name:

## Instruction:

1. Study the code and video below:

   https://github.com/zhamri/STIW3054-RT-Programming/blob/master/src/Week_06/TestSynchronizedCounter.java
   
   Video --> [Java Thread | Synchronization using “synchronized” keyword](https://youtu.be/zZ_iBMi-hrI)

1. Then write a Java program to start __TWO (2)__ threads where:
    * 1st thread will increment the number by 1 for x times. Create a class called MyIncrement to do this task. 
    * 2nd thread will decrement the number by 1 for x times. Create a class called MyDecrement to do this task.
   
1. x is an integer number and MUST be input from the keyboard. Video --> [Java | Getting user input using 'Scanner' class](https://youtu.be/laOtr6GYXDg)

1. The 1st thread should finish first and follow by the 2nd thread. Then display the result. 

1. Use the Counter class, which has the increment and the decrement methods.

1. Calculate the execution time using Apache Stopwatch. Video --> [Apache StopWatch | How to calculate Execution Time in Java](https://youtu.be/coEa48WDDno)

1. Then compare the results between synchronized and non-synchronized methods for the increment and the decrement.

1. The program file with the main method should be named MySynchronized.java and placed in the src/main/java/my/uum/ folder.

1. Screenshot the result and upload it to this repo too.

1. If you have a problem with the Maven Project, watch the video for the configuration: [IntelliJ IDEA | Creating a new configuration for running Java program](https://youtu.be/h2DT2SsPX1M)
1. Watch the video to clone, add, commit and push a repository to GitHub: [IntelliJ IDEA | How to clone, add, commit and push a repository to GitHub easily](https://youtu.be/RXV3Yusr0SI)

## Example of the output
```
Please input x: 1000

Result (non-synchronized method): xxx
Execution Time: xxx milliseconds

Result (synchronized method): xxx
Execution Time: xxx milliseconds
```
